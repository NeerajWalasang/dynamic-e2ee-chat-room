# Secure AI-Powered Chat Room

A modern, end-to-end encrypted chat room platform powered by **AI-based dynamic key generation** using LSTM neural networks.  
Frontend built with **React** + **Firebase**; backend powered by **Flask** (Python), **TensorFlow/Keras** LSTM, and strong AES encryption.  
Messages are encrypted with a unique, session-specific key generated by an AI model that evolves based on chat context.

---

## Features

- **End-to-End Encryption** — Every message is encrypted with a key that is dynamically generated using an LSTM model.
- **AI-Driven Security** — Key generation uses chat history, session ID, and user info for maximal unpredictability.
- **No Sign-Up Needed** — Join anonymously via one-click disposable links.
- **Cross-device** — Works on any device with a modern web browser.
- **Open Source** — All code is on GitHub. Contributions welcome!

- **Frontend:** React (with Firebase Firestore/Anon Auth)
- **Backend:** Flask (Python), TensorFlow/Keras, Flask-CORS
- **Encryption:** AES-256-CBC, PKCS7 Padding (Python cryptography)
- **Dynamic Keys:** Generated per message/session by LSTM on chat context

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/VenkateshBadiger/secure-chat-app.git
cd secure-chat-app
2. Backend Setup (Flask + AI Key Server)
bash
Copy
Edit
cd ai_key_server
# Create a virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # or venv\Scripts\activate on Windows

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install flask-cors

# Start the Flask server
python app.py
Make sure you are using Python 3.10 (not 3.12) due to TensorFlow compatibility.

Place keygen.py and random_messages_dataset.csv in the same directory as app.py.

3. Frontend Setup (React + Firebase)
bash
Copy
Edit
cd ../secure-chat-app-main
npm install
npm start
Update src/firebaseConfig.js or directly in App.js with your own Firebase credentials if you fork.

By default, app runs at http://localhost:3000.

Usage
Start the backend Flask server (port 5001).

Start the React frontend (port 3000).

Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser.

Click "Create chat link" and share with friends.
Open the link in a new tab to join as another user.

Chat securely — each message is encrypted with a dynamic, AI-generated key!

The backend terminal logs:

Sender

Message

Encryption Key (hex)

Cipher Text (hex)
for each message sent.

Security Notes
All encryption/decryption is performed on the server (Flask).

Keys are never reused for a different context.

The LSTM is trained on chat patterns, providing dynamic keys per session.

For a truly production-grade E2EE system, you should move encryption to the client (not just the server).
